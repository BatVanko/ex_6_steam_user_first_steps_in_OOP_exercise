# ex_6_steam_user_first_steps_in_OOP_exercise

Create a class called SteamUser. Upon initialization, it should receive a username (string) and games (list). It should also have an attribute called played_hours (0 by default). Add three methods to the class:
-	play(game, hours)
o	If the game is in the game list, increase the played_hours by the given hours and return "{username} is playing {game}"
o	Otherwise, return "{game} is not in library"
-	buy_game(game)
o	If the game is not in the game list, add it and return "{username} bought {game}"
o	Otherwise, return "{game} is already in your library"
-	status() - returns the following:
    "{username} has {games_count} games. Total play time: {played_hours}"

Test Code

user = SteamUser("Peter", ["Rainbow Six Siege", "CS:GO", "Fortnite"])
print(user.play("Fortnite", 3))
print(user.play("Oxygen Not Included", 5))
print(user.buy_game("CS:GO"))
print(user.buy_game("Oxygen Not Included"))
print(user.play("Oxygen Not Included", 6))
print(user.status())

Output

Peter is playing Fortnite
Oxygen Not Included is not in library
CS:GO is already in your library
Peter bought Oxygen Not Included
Peter is playing Oxygen Not Included
Peter has 4 games. Total play time: 9
